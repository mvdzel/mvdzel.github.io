This portfolio highlights my experience in health information technology, contributing to complex interoperability projects, with a strong focus on data mapping, standards implementation, and automated tooling, with a focus on FHIR and related technologies.

## Standards Development Support & Implementation

**[HL7 International](https://hl7.org) (2015-Present)**

* EHR-S Functional Model (FM) & Functional Profile (FP) (2021-Present)
    * Migrate the publication tools to the HL7 Common Toolset (FHIR IG) (2023-Present)
    * Generated multiple FM/FP publications.
    * Toolsmith of the publication tools for the EHR-S FM/FP specifications.
* Separate [EHRS RLE IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ehrs-rle/history.html) from core FHIR specs, aligh with FHIR R5 and bring to ballot.

**[J-P-Systems](https://jpsys.com) (2019-Present)**

* VistA Data Mapping & FHIR Implementation (2019-Present)
    * Developed "dictionaries" to support mappings between VistA data elements and various standards, including us-core, SDA VPR and CDW
    * Performed rigorous QA and cross-checking of mappings to ensure accuracy and consistency.
    * Automated the generation of FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) from spreadsheet-based mappings using FSH (FHIR Shorthand).
    * Implemented GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) and automated publication of IGs.
* AMPL GUI FHIR STU3 Mapping (2019-2020)
    * Create dictionary from VistA OSHERA.
    * Generated a FHIR IG from spreadsheet-based mappings.

**[Nictiz](https://nictiz.nl) (2017-2020)**

* Contributed to the development and maintenance of several key standards:
    * ISO 13972 (2020)
    * CDA and DCM (zibs) (2019, 2017)

**Parelsnoer Project (2016-2018)**

* Provided Detailed Clinical Models (DCM) support
